The Rolling Stones are one of my favorite bands and one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.  Keith is a very unique player with a sound all his own.  If you dig his playing, or even if you're just a vintage gear nut, check out this run down on his guitars and amps.  The dude's Fender Twin is serial #00003!!
